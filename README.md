This study explores the possibility of extracting personality traits through a conversational dataset using natural language
processing. The personality traits we are exploring is the big five O.C.E.A.N traits. We examined how specific personality
traits correlates with linguistic choices and conversational patterns. We make us of metrics such as vocabulary diversity, word
frequency and word category analysis. Additionally machine learning models were implemented for the use of predicting per-
sonality traits, and then abstracting those traits to predict the speakers in the dataset.
